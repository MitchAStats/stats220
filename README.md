# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in commerce and science majoring in economics, statistics and business analytics 
- I am taking STATS 220 because is will provide some core data handiling skills to further my carrer (hopefully)
- I am interested in learning about how to best produce insightful r documents 

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![](https://c.tenor.com/8druEACXtX8AAAAd/tenor.gif)
