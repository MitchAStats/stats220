# Stats220

This repository contains all my work in the Stats 220 course at the University of Auckland. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in commerce and science majoring in economics, statistics and business analytics 
- I am taking STATS 220 because is will provide some core data handiling skills to further my carrer (hopefully)
- I am interested in learning about how to best produce insightful r documents
